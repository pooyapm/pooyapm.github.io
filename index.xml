Here, I try to introduce a systematic way to analyze chess puzzles and solve them. This can be used as a framework, so right after you see the position you know exactly where to start and check for alternative solutions.</description>

Normally, a SW system takes some inputs and then it performs some processing on it and then it returns some output or takes action as the result.
