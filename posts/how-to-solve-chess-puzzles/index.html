<p>use small patterns to build larger patterns</p>
<p>Hook
Overview of problem solving
Pattern recognition beings
Working memory capacity and its role in problem solving, so patterns are important
Known patterns 
First objective, experience from known patterns helps you here to identify the patterns
Helps to identify small patterns
Importance of the learning process on the side
Check for small patterns
Look for weaknesses
Same row
Same column
Unprotected
Less supported pieces
Forks
Trapped
Look for supported 
Squares
Columns
Rows
Diagonals
Combine the moves to come up with a bigger pattern
How after one move opponent will defend
Which is supported
Squares
Columns
Rows
Diagonals
Pieces
When move to a new position
What is supported
New small patterns from new positions<br>
Rearrange the moves</p>
<p>Example must:
Different possible objectives
One objective must not work
Learning must help to guess possible small patterns
Different small patterns
Weakness must help to identify small pattern 
One arrange must be defended
Second arrange can work
One picture of all working togther</p>
