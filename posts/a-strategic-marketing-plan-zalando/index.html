  "articleBody": "Section 1: Analysis 1.1 Context Zalando is Europe’s leading online fashion platform, selling all fashion products in all assortments from over 3000+ international and local brands as well as its own private brand products. It is currently operating in 17 european countries. It was established in 2008 in Berlin as a pioneering e-commerce shoe selling platform.\nZalando’s key markets are european countries. Zalando’s vision and strategy for the coming years is to grow. Zalando can achieve this growth through different channels and in all of them different marketing strategies will help them achieve their goal.\nThe corporate strategy is focused on two areas: The online platform and business fields.\nCorporate strategy at Zalando can be summarised as follows:\nThe best way to achieve growth and take digitization forward is through a platform-based business model. For customers best shopping experience with the most extensive assortment with current season’s trends and maximum availability. Inspire through personalization. Invest in payment, supplier, customer services as well as return process to make the transaction process as simple and smooth as possible. The second area is brand partners and the third pillar of the platform is the infrastructure which forms the foundation for different services for both customers and partners.\nThey have the intention to increase market share in the growing and more digitized fashion industry.\nOne possible growth strategy could be formulated as follows:\nIn 17 european countries with operating business, Zalando as market leader tries to keep market share and focus on fostering customer relation and loyalty through more personalized offerings In operating countries engage more brand partners with new service based businesses Penetrate other european countries in which the business is not operational: Portugal, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia Zalando has many stakeholders:\nThe founders and owners of Zaalando Customers from around the continent Designers working with Zalando 3000+ brands partnered with Zalando or selling their stock on Zalando’s platform Employees Local and international competitors And as mentioned in their sustainability strategy of the company, all the people in the world and even the next generations! 1.2 Marketing fit with business and corporate strategy Zalando’s online platform is at the core of their business.\nThe organization is large and IT and logistics are the core competence of the whole value chain. Over the years Zalando has grown to cover vertically all parts of the value chain from design to production, sell and distribution.\nSWOT analysis can confirm the company’s favorable position.\nSWOT analysis.\rPorter’s generic strategy analysis is that Zalando has differentiated values in the customer’s minds with free of charge delivery and returns and possibility to compare the price and quality of different brands.\nAnsoff’s growth strategies framework can show that Zalando could seek to penetrate new markets within Europe, make more partnerships with local and international brands.\nZalando believes the online retail e-commerce fashion is at its growth phase of product life cycle, so it means that they believe there is more market share that can be captured and more competitors still might get into the competition.\n1.3 Environmental Analysis The micro and macro environment should be continuously analyzed and be used as input to marketing strategic plan.\nPESTLE analysis tool can be used to capture environmental analysis.\nThe political environment: as Zalando is also operating in the UK the most recent major political shift is Brexit and its legal impacts on business like new tariffs and rules on import and export which might be considered in future plans.\nThe economic environment: COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world including european countries than Zalando is operating in. A thorough analysis on the employment rate and GDP growth for all countries must be taken into account to capture major trend shifts. Apart from pandemic impacts, most of European countries experiencing slow economic growth (GDP growth od 1.5%-3%)\nThe sociocultural and demographic environment: on average most of Europe’s population is between 24-55. Most Europe’s population has internet access and mobile internet access. Culturally it can be said that all european countries fall into the same cultural and religious cluster.\nThe technological environment: new advancements made in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as well as Big data, virtual reality opens up the doors for Zalando to offer more personalized product offerings as well as virtual at home showroom experience.\nThe legal environment: since Zalando deals with customer’s online data, GDPR legal impacts must be considered.\nThe natural (environmental) environment: On the platform side perhaps it has not much impact on Zalando, but in terms of the private labels or the partner brands they must take into account the more environmentally aware customers.\nTo use Porter’s five forces, we know that the online retail platform is at the core of Zalando’s business which other services are based around. So, we apply analysis on this platform.\nThe threat of new entrants: Zalando’s power is in a strong customer base which is difficult for new entrants to get. Low risk here. The threat of substitutes: current available substitutes are Boozt or Amazon or local platforms, and there is a slight chance of customers switching. The bargaining power of suppliers: it is low as currently they have over 3000 brands and partners, but for traditional famous and luxury brands they may have more power and this must be considered in contract’s terms. The bargaining power of customers: in terms of platform their bargaining power will be to switch to other competitors which is currently slim. The strength of competitive rivalry: Amazon has all resources to position themselves in direct competition, Zalando needs to differentiate from Zalando by for example focusing only on clothes and apparels. Critical success factors seem to be ease of use of platform, fast delivery, easy and free returns, partnership with as many different brands as possible.\n1.4 Customer Insights The business is both business-to-customer and business-to-business.\nThe retail business-to-customer part of Zalando offers different products from international well known brands to local brands in different assortments, to different customers in all ages, and since it is operating mainly in western europe we can assume the market is predominantly customized for these cultural values. The consumers are probably internet savvy and prefer online shopping, and interested in the core value that Zalando offers which is the convenience of free and fast delivery and return.\nConsumer buying decision process is strongly related to the core business of Zalando. The five step buying decision model consists of problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision and post purchase behaviour. One of the main reasons that customers may select the Zalando platform for their shopping is the ability to instantly compare between different alternatives. They can also instantly get a lot of information about different products, review other customers’ feedback which helps them to make the decision to buy an item on the platform. Another important factor is the after purchase behaviour, that they can provide ratings and feedback on the platform on their level of satisfaction, and if they are not happy with the buy they can simply return the item easily and free of charge. So, these core competences of Zalando can influence the customers’ decision process. Also, if strong relation and loyalty exists between Zalando and customers and customers become regular re-visitors, then their personal data such as payment and delivery methods and customer credibility can be used to make the feeling of shopping even more smoother.\n1.5 Capturing Marketing Insights The main data to capture to keep the current customer base in operating countries and foster loyalty can be directly captured from the platform. Other types of data could be governments reports on economic growth, inflation rate, etc. Another data can be collected from social media, stylists and influencers’ opinions and also market research either done by internal resources or expert consultancy firms. Market research is especially important to identify how trends shift with demographics and fashion trends.\nMarketing insights.\rZalando can use the ‘Market-Buildup’ method to estimate business buyers for its new services. Fortunately it has already the list of potential buyers as they are already using the platform. Then Zalando can estimate their sales and use of their own logistics and from there prioritize the list of all potential buyers.\nMultiple-factor-index can be used to estimate area market potential for the new countries they want to enter. Such an index assigns different factors different weights. The factors useful in Zalando’s case might be the disposable income, e-commercial sales and e-commerce fashion sales in the region.\nWe assume based on the information collected the corporate strategy used as input for strategic marketing plan is to keep the leadership position in currently operating countries in e-commerce retail apparel business as well as geographical expansion to portugal for their online retail platform.\nThe new features to be introduced are more AI based personalized offerings and automated style advisor as well as virtual at home showrooms.\nGDP per capita for European countries.\rImplications of the given scenario for the analysis\nThis scenario is all good news for Zalando as it is established to help people do their clothing shopping online. Zalando had identified that fashion e-commerce is in a growth phase product life cycle and they expected more and more people to use such services in future. This scenario has made this transition to happen faster and earlier than expected and perhaps taking Zalando by surprise. The further implications of this scenario on their business will be discussed in coming sections.\nSection 2: Planning 2.1 Segmentation Important consumer based segmentation factors are geographic, demographic, social and psychographic dimensions. However, since Zalando has a great customer data available, they can take even more advanced approaches. They can combine attitudes of the consumers from the previous shoppings they had and create even narrower and more effective segments.\nFor segmentation regarding new B2B service offerings (which we don’t focus on here) major segmentation variables for business markets are demographic, operating variables, purchasing approaches, situational factors and personal characteristics.\nFor new features marketing, they can rely on the current customers which already use the platform or use the personal stylists.\nSegmentation for new markets they want to enter (Portugal):\nDemographic Age Income Working class Product category Luxury Mainstream Local -Social Internet savvy Online shopping Zalando has never operated in Portugal and only has access to public data, so it has to rely on the generic segmentation criterias at the beginning. However, it can reuse some trends found in countries with similar cultures and attitudes. For example, data gained in Spain can be used to create narrower segments. Portugees resonate with Spanish a lot!\n2.2 Targeting For service business the target segment is: small-mid size brands, located in one country and operating in other countries, have difficulties with logistics, (medium to large order size/brand size), do not have a strong customer base and data for marketing. The criterias for segment targeting are:\nThe segment is measurable: Zalando knows exactly which brands fall into this category from its own platform data. Substantial and growing market: They are small and mid size or local brands, they have potential for growth, and Zalando platform and logistics, delivery and marketing and design advice can help them grow even faster Easily accessible: they are already working with each other, so it will be modify buy Segment is differentiable: they are in the same business as Zalando, they have the need for fashion related logistics and expertise and marketing capabilities Segment is actionable: just let them know about the new services, and they probably come onboard themselves! Porter’s five forces can also be applicable. There is significant segment rivalry probably only from Amazon, but since it is not focused on fashion and Zalando and these brands work together, it seems no major threat from Amazon should be assumed. It takes a lot of customer base and data and infrastructure to enter this market which is not easy.\nTarget segmentations for the new markets: Age between 24-55, currently employed professional, mid level income, interested in non-expensive mainstream products, internet savvy, using social media and used online shopping. The reason is that this group is likely to have good social media and real world connections, so are good to create awareness at the beginning of introduction. They are working class and use online shopping, so likely to try this new platform out. The products presented on the platform should be from world wide well known brands or local brands, at the beginning because the potential customers are familiar with them.\nFor new features as mentioned before they can rely on the current customer base and provide the offering for everyone already using the platform.\n2.3 Branding and Positioning Brand is the unique image and perception that Zalando wants its customers to remember about them. What Zalando wants is that everytime a person wants to buy a pair of shoes, they remember Zalando as the first option as they have the experience of easy shopping, fast delivery and free return. If such an image is built in customers’ minds then the customers will be loyal and keep returning to Zalando for shopping which guarantees a constant stream of revenue.\nWe divide the branding and positioning strategy into the two different areas considered in this document. First branding and positioning for entering Portugal as a new market. Second, is branding and positioning for new features added to the platform: AI based offerings and automated personal stylist as well as virtual at home showroom.\nBrand Resonance Model can be used to identify different elements to build the brand to enter Portugal as a new market.\nBrand salience: as Portugal is a new market people might not be aware about Zalando. However, they might have heard it and even be waiting for it to start operating in Portugal as they might have heard it from friends outside the country. Brand performance: as they have a large customer base in other countries and have grown it over time, we can say that they have performed well enough and this may continue in Portugal as well. Brand imagery: in my mind as a customer the extrinsic values of Zalando is clear to be fast delivery, easy shopping feeling and free return. Brand judgements: again myself as a customer quite satisfied with the service received from Zalando. Brand feelings: maybe not that much related as there must not be that much emotional attachment with the brand. Brand resonance: maybe for the customers who value free return there might be resonating with the brand. Different elements of the brand can be checked such as url, logo, platform, different services to see how they are perceived in customers (potential customers) minds. We can also examine the platform and services as whole as a brand element itself:\nMemorable: I can judge myself as whenever I have to do shopping the first option coming to my mind is Zalando. Meaningful: for people who want easy comparison of different brands and do not want to go to shopping malls, the brand is quite meaningful. Likable: not very much applicable for the generic crowd but for those who use the personal stylists or fashion advice it might be more applicable. Transferable: it is easily transferable, for example in this case just with minor modifications of the website to local language the whole brand can be transferred to Portugal. Adaptable: it is adaptable in the sense that easily new brands can be onboarded, enter new segments, add new categories, etc. Protectable: some elements of the brand are legally protectable such as the logo, private labels and trademarks. Competitor analysis based on two features. The first feature is the\rspecializing in clothing. The second feature is free/easy return.\rCompetitor analysis based on two features. The first feature is the\rspecializing in clothing. The second feature is fast delivery.\rTwo perceptual maps are introduced here. One shows easy/free return versus specialized in clothing and fashion. The other one is fast delivery versus specialized in clothing. We can see tha Zalando can differentiate itself from the competition :\nFast delivery Free and easy return We can think of these as the supplementary added value to the core services that are more or less provided by all competitors. Such core services are the ability to compare different brands, large number of brands and easy/smooth shopping. Finally the brand mantra can be stated as:\nAll your favorite brands at your door, with one click! Return, if you don’t like!\nFor the new personalized AI based offering and stylist, this is an innovative solution and probably Zalando will be the pioneer offering such service. It can be offered to current customers of the platform to increase the sales or even attract new customers and decrease unnecessary returns which impose a lot of burden on the company.\nThe brand mantra for this new feature can be stated as:\nYour personal stylist, true feeling of happiness!\nFor this new feature, perhaps brand revitalization and reinforcement might be needed since it is new and customers are not aware of it.\n2.4 Selection of Marketing Strategy Zalando is mostly operating in slow economic growth countries and the product life cycle is considered to be at its growth phase (according to Zalando).\nZalando is a leader as a platform should maintain its leadership position by adding new features and entering new segments such as B2B service offerings.\nZalando is considered to be a challenger as it enters the market in Portugal. They would like to first create the awareness of Zalando and its platform in Portugal and then create the same differentiated position in the customers’ minds as they have previously created before in other countries to be known as the best platform for comparing different brands and easy navigation, easy payment and free and simple return specialized in clothing assortments.\nImplications of the given scenario for planning\nWith the given scenario we can expect to have more potential customers in the near future. One of the implications on planning is that we can include a larger extent of people to be included in the target group instead of limiting it to only the age 24-55. Also, the target segment customers do not need to be internet savvy any longer as the new trend suggests that more and more people are going to use online platforms and services.\nOne of the reasons for such a trend shift during these times is that people have been forced to try these online services and now they have experienced the comfort and they can trust the online payment systems. So, for Zalando to be able to capture more market share they have to be bolder in their differentiation factors in branding and positioning. So they have to emphasize more and more on faster delivery and free returns that other competitors may not have the resources to promise.\nSection 3: Implementation 3.1 Integrated Marketing Mix Integrated marketing mix deals with all encounters of the customers with different parts of the business and tries to build up the desired perception of the business and brand and differentiated position in the customers’ (potential customers) minds.\nLike before the focus is on the online retail platform. The corporate strategy goal was:\nIn currently operating countries with above 5% GDP growth Keeping the leader position In currently operating countries with slow economic growth Add new features Enter new segments such as new B2B transport service offering (not the scope of this strategic marketing plan) In new entering countries (Portugal) Create and raise awareness of the service existence Marketing focus on competitive advantage of the service, easy order, payment, delivery and return, fast and home delivery Zalando mainly offers online retail service to consumers. Services are different from products as they are intangible, perishable, inseparable and variable. Zalando falls into the service category of tangible goods with accompanying service as it has to deliver the goods from other brands through their service to customers.\nSERVQUAL five determinants of service quality are reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles which we will see how should be addressed in an integrated marketing mix.\nHere our focus will also be on the platform mainly as Zalando’s core business.\n3.2 Product The product relevant for integrated marketing mix here is the platform and product package.\nFor the newly added features Zalando must make sure in every step by using design thinking that the feature is designed to fulfil customers needs by getting continuous feedback, they also must assure it is easy to use and it provides meaningful results. packaging and labelling can be also considered as products in this context. Zalando has to make sure their package is of high standard of safety and easy to handle, for example easy to carry and easy to open or repack for return. They have to make sure the shipped items are not damaged or faulty. Also, providing warranty from branding partners could be good marketing practice.\nThe platform language can have a lot of importance especially in Europe with many different languages. So, they can add portugese language for the platform before entering Portugal can help them for mass adoption significantly.\n3.3 Price All services offered to customers are free. As a strong customer base gives a huge competitive advantage to Zalando and also prohibits new entrants to the competition it is wise to continue with this strategy and also offer the new features of AI stylist and virtual showroom to customers for free just to increase market share and offer services in Portugal for free to let more people try the service out and build loyalty.\nCompetitors also provide the platform services for free to attract more customers. So, according to Kotler and Keller six steps of setting the price it is also justified to provide free services to address the competition.\n3.4 Place Zalando pursues omnichannel marketing, the online platform.\nThey can use a mix of push and pull strategy for marketing, meaning that they can collaborate with brands in their marketing efforts (push strategy) but also try to attract more customers to buy from their platform.\nThe whole value chain channels are important for marketing integrated mix. Supply chain channels, transport and delivery channels, warehouses and inventories, order channels, payment channels, etc. marketers have to choose and manage the channels.\nSpecifically for Zalando we know that fast delivery and free return are the differentiators. It is crucial for marketers to make sure inventories, warehouses, transport and delivery channels work in tandem for fast delivery and return to happen as smoothly as possible. As Zalando enters Portugal, they have to prepare the infrastructure in such a way that from first customers the differentiating image of fast delivery and good packaging and free return sticks with customers.\n3.5 Promotion Zalando uses different forms of promotion channels and media communications. This includes heavy social media appearance, bloggers, models, paper and digital magazines, partner brands discounts, coupons and many other forms.\nWe know that Millennials account for 40% of the world’s population by 2020, and they spend a lot of time on social media platforms so it seems reasonable for Zalando to be present on such platforms for promotion of their ecommerce platform and the newly added features.\nSpeciality for the new features, the innovation adoption curve is very important. Maybe through promotion by the models and social media influencers they can get the 2.5% innovators to try it first and then the early adopters will pick it up and then through word of mouth they reach the tipping point and mass adoption for new features could happen.\nThe same is true for entering Portugal. Local models and influencers as well as celebrities can be employed at the initial phase of introduction to increase the knowledge and awareness of this platform entering the market.\n3.6 People All people that face customers such as delivery staff and customer support might be very well trained to build up the image that Zalando desires. Delivery staff specially have a very important impact on the perception of people so they must be very well dressed and polite and behave to the highest standard. Customer support must handle complaints professionally and politely to keep the unsatisfied customers returning back for shopping to Zalando.\n3.7 Process Easy use of online retail platforms is crucial for successful business such as Zalando. Customers’ interaction with the service is through the platform so it is very important that the processes done on the platform be as easy and smooth as possible. These processes include navigation, search and comparison, add to box, payment and return processes.\nSpecially providing personalized offers to avoid confusing customers and delaying the buy, having different payment methods and easy return process are very important. Easy and free return is a differentiator factor for Zalando so they have to make sure the process is clear like having the printed return address in the package helps to create a unique image in customers minds.\n3.8 Physical Evidence The physical evidence that customers encounter is the platform’s website and product packaging as well as delivery staff. So, Zalando has to make sure that the website is professionally designed. Also, packaging must be well designed and safe to avoid damages on transportation.\nImplications of the given scenario for implementation\nAs the trend shows an increase in ecommerce and online shopping, it surely increases the customers using Zalando services both in short term and long term. In the short term as the infrastructure for transport and delivery or inventory might not be ready for a huge spike it might impact the perception of customers especially the first timers. It is important to inform the customers about the possible delays and unusual circumstances that are incurred to protect the brand image in the long run.\nIn the long run, they need to prepare the infrastructure to handle this increase in demand to continue keeping the image of fast delivery and free return. They have to employ different promotion campaigns to take advantage of this trend shift and increase their market share for example by providing coupons or special discounts for first time buyers or bonus for recommending to friends.\nSection 4: Feedback and Control 4.1 Control of Strategic Marketing Activities Zalando goal is to engage more customers to use the new features and increase awareness in Portugal and onboard more customers. Different strategic and operational metrics and control plans could be implemented to track the success in reaching these goals.\nStrategic goals:\nMarket share per country of operation Number of partner brands Number of customers Profit Sales Number of users using new features The operational metrics to monitor particularly important for Zalando could be as follows in different categories.\nPlatform use process:\nNumber of website visits Add to basket Number of item buys Add Card number Percentage of use of different payment methods Time spent for search Number of visits before buy Inventory/Warehouse to delivery: Time from order to packaging Time from order to delivery Customer feedback on delivery status Returns: Percentage of returns Brands of returns Feedback on returns Brand partners to warehouse transport: Time from order to receive in Zalando inventory Metrics to follow up on success rate of marketing promotions also need to be tracked:\nPercentage of social media to website visits Impact of discounts Impact of bonus and coupons Blog reads Impact of influencers and celebrities Also, change introduces its own risks. Now Zalando wants to go through two major changes. One is the introduction of features that are new across industry and one is entering Portugal. These both could impose operational and strategic marketing risks. The likelihood of success of these changes must be considered and make sure the impact of failure is justifiable in terms of cost and most importantly the brand image in the minds of customers.\nImplications of the given scenario for feedback and control\nAll the above mentioned metrics to control will be useful also for this trend shift. Particularly Zalando must follow this trend shift in longer timeframes to exactly monitor how this trend change is happening, in which areas and countries, what type of products and how it is impacting the delivery times and how to identify inventory or transport service possible bottlenecks and issues. Such trend shift minitorings helps to get prepared for the increase in demand impact on infrastructure in the long run.\nReferences:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population https://corporate.zalando.com/en?market=se https://craft.co/zalando/competitors ",

<h2 id="11-context">1.1 Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#11-context">#</a></h2>
<p>Zalando is Europe&rsquo;s leading online fashion platform, selling all fashion products in all assortments from over 3000+ international and local brands as well as its own private brand products. It is currently operating in 17 european countries. It was established in 2008 in Berlin as a pioneering e-commerce shoe selling platform.</p>
<p>Zalando’s key markets are european countries. Zalando’s vision and strategy for the coming years is to grow. Zalando can achieve this growth through different channels and in all of them different marketing strategies will help them achieve their goal.</p>
<p>The corporate strategy is focused on two areas: The online platform and business fields.</p>
<p>Corporate strategy at Zalando can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>The best way to achieve growth and take digitization forward is through a platform-based business model. For customers best shopping experience with the most extensive assortment with current season’s trends and maximum availability. Inspire through personalization. Invest in payment, supplier, customer services as well as return process to make the transaction process as simple and smooth as possible. The second area is brand partners and the third pillar of the platform is the infrastructure which forms the foundation for different services for both customers and partners.</p>
<p>They have the intention to increase market share in the growing and more digitized fashion industry.</p>
<p>One possible growth strategy could be formulated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 17 european countries with operating business, Zalando as market leader tries to keep market share and focus on fostering customer relation and loyalty through more personalized offerings</li>
<li>In operating countries engage more brand partners with new service based businesses</li>
<li>Penetrate other european countries in which the business is not operational: Portugal, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia</li>
</ul>
<p>Zalando has many stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>The founders and owners of Zaalando</li>
<li>Customers from around the continent</li>
<li>Designers working with Zalando</li>
<li>3000+ brands partnered with Zalando or selling their stock on Zalando’s platform</li>
<li>Employees</li>
<li>Local and international competitors</li>
<li>And as mentioned in their sustainability strategy of the company, all the people in the world and even the next generations!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="12-marketing-fit-with-business-and-corporate-strategy">1.2 Marketing fit with business and corporate strategy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#12-marketing-fit-with-business-and-corporate-strategy">#</a></h2>
<p>Zalando’s online platform is at the core of their business.</p>
<p>The organization is large and IT and logistics are the core competence of the whole value chain. Over the years Zalando has grown to cover vertically all parts of the value chain from design to production, sell and distribution.</p>
<p>SWOT analysis can confirm the company’s favorable position.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="../../images/SWOT.PNG" alt="SWOT analysis" style="margin-left: 5%; width:90%">
  <figcaption style="text-align:center">SWOT analysis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Porter’s generic strategy analysis is that Zalando has differentiated values in the customer&rsquo;s minds with free of charge delivery and returns and possibility to compare the price and quality of different brands.</p>
<p>Ansoff’s growth strategies framework can show that Zalando could seek to penetrate new markets within Europe, make more partnerships with local and international brands.</p>
<p>Zalando believes the online retail e-commerce fashion is at its growth phase of product life cycle, so it means that they believe there is more market share that can be captured and more competitors still might get into the competition.</p>
<h2 id="13-environmental-analysis">1.3 Environmental Analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#13-environmental-analysis">#</a></h2>
<p>The micro and macro environment should be continuously analyzed and be used as input to marketing strategic plan.</p>
<p>PESTLE analysis tool can be used to capture environmental analysis.</p>
<p>The <strong>political</strong> environment: as Zalando is also operating in the UK the most recent major political shift is Brexit and its legal impacts on business like new tariffs and rules on import and export which might be considered in future plans.</p>
<p>The <strong>economic</strong> environment: COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world including european countries than Zalando is operating in. A thorough analysis on the employment rate and GDP growth for all countries must be taken into account to capture major trend shifts. Apart from pandemic impacts, most of European countries experiencing slow economic growth (GDP growth od 1.5%-3%)</p>
<p>The <strong>sociocultural and demographic</strong> environment: on average most of Europe&rsquo;s population is between 24-55. Most Europe’s population has internet access and mobile internet access. Culturally it can be said that all european countries fall into the same cultural and religious cluster.</p>
<p>The <strong>technological</strong> environment: new advancements made in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as well as Big data, virtual reality opens up the doors for Zalando to  offer more personalized product offerings as well as virtual at home showroom experience.</p>
<p>The <strong>legal</strong> environment: since Zalando deals with customer’s online data, GDPR legal impacts must be considered.</p>
<p>The <strong>natural (environmental)</strong> environment: On the platform side perhaps it has not much impact on Zalando, but in terms of the private labels or the partner brands they must take into account the more environmentally aware customers.</p>
<p>To use Porter’s five forces, we know that the online retail platform is at the core of Zalando’s business which other services are based around. So, we apply analysis on this platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>The threat of new entrants: Zalando&rsquo;s power is in a strong customer base which is difficult for new entrants to get. Low risk here.</li>
<li>The threat of substitutes: current available substitutes are Boozt or Amazon or local platforms, and there is a slight chance of customers switching.</li>
<li>The bargaining power of suppliers: it is low as currently they have over 3000 brands and partners, but for traditional famous and luxury brands they may have more power and this must be considered in contract’s terms.</li>
<li>The bargaining power of customers: in terms of platform their bargaining power will be to switch to other competitors which is currently slim.</li>
<li>The strength of competitive rivalry: Amazon has all resources to position themselves in direct competition, Zalando needs to differentiate from Zalando by for example focusing only on clothes and apparels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Critical success factors seem to be ease of use of platform, fast delivery, easy and free returns, partnership with as many different brands as possible.</p>
<h2 id="14-customer-insights">1.4 Customer Insights<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#14-customer-insights">#</a></h2>
<p>The business is both business-to-customer and business-to-business.</p>
<p>The retail business-to-customer part of Zalando offers different products from international well known brands to local brands in different assortments, to different customers in all ages, and since it is operating mainly in western europe we can assume the market is predominantly customized for these cultural values. The consumers are probably internet savvy and prefer online shopping, and interested in the core value that Zalando offers which is the convenience of free and fast delivery and return.</p>
<p>Consumer buying decision process is strongly related to the core business of Zalando. The five step buying decision model consists of problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision and post purchase behaviour.  One of the main reasons that customers may select the Zalando platform for their shopping is the ability to instantly compare between different alternatives. They can also instantly get a lot of information about different products, review other customers&rsquo; feedback which helps them to make the decision to buy an item on the platform. Another important factor is the after purchase behaviour, that they can provide ratings and feedback on the platform on their level of satisfaction, and if they are not happy with the buy they can simply return the item easily and free of charge. So, these core competences of Zalando can influence the customers’ decision process. Also, if strong relation and loyalty exists between Zalando and customers and customers become regular re-visitors, then their personal data such as payment and delivery methods and customer credibility can be used to make the feeling of shopping even more smoother.</p>
<h2 id="15-capturing-marketing-insights">1.5 Capturing Marketing Insights<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#15-capturing-marketing-insights">#</a></h2>
<p>The main data to capture to keep the current customer base in operating countries and foster loyalty can be directly captured from the platform. Other types of data could be governments reports on economic growth, inflation rate, etc.  Another data can be collected from social media, stylists and influencers’ opinions and also market research either done by internal resources or expert consultancy firms. Market research is especially important to identify how trends shift with demographics and fashion trends.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="../../images/marketing-insight.PNG" alt="Marketing insights" style="margin-left: 5%; width:90%">
  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Marketing insights.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Zalando can use the ‘Market-Buildup’ method to estimate business buyers for its new services. Fortunately it has already the list of potential buyers as they are already using the platform. Then Zalando can estimate their sales and use of their own logistics and from there prioritize the list of all potential buyers.</p>
<p>Multiple-factor-index can be used to estimate area market potential for the new countries they want to enter. Such an index assigns different factors different weights. The factors useful in Zalando’s case might be the disposable income, e-commercial sales and e-commerce fashion sales in the region.</p>
<p><strong>We assume based on the information collected the corporate strategy used as input for strategic marketing plan is to keep the leadership position in currently operating countries in e-commerce retail apparel business as well as geographical expansion to portugal for their online retail platform.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The new features to be introduced are more AI based personalized offerings and automated style advisor as well as virtual at home showrooms.</strong></p>

<p>Implications of the given scenario for the analysis</p>
<p>This scenario is all good news for Zalando as it is established to help people do their clothing shopping online. Zalando had identified that fashion e-commerce is in a growth phase product life cycle and they expected more and more people to use such services in future. This scenario has made this transition to happen faster and earlier than expected and perhaps taking Zalando by surprise. The further implications of this scenario on their business will be discussed in coming sections.</p>
<h1 id="section-2-planning">Section 2: Planning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-2-planning">#</a></h1>
<h2 id="21-segmentation">2.1 Segmentation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#21-segmentation">#</a></h2>
<p>Important consumer based segmentation factors are geographic, demographic, social and psychographic dimensions. However, since Zalando has a great customer data available, they can take even more advanced approaches. They can combine attitudes of the consumers from the previous shoppings they had and create even narrower and more effective segments.</p>
<p>For segmentation regarding new B2B service offerings (which we don’t focus on here) major segmentation variables for business markets are demographic, operating variables, purchasing approaches, situational factors and personal characteristics.</p>
<p>For new features marketing, they can rely on the current customers which already use the platform or use the personal stylists.</p>
<p>Segmentation for new markets they want to enter (Portugal):</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Working class</li>
<li>Product category
<ul>
<li>Luxury</li>
<li>Mainstream</li>
<li>Local
-Social</li>
<li>Internet savvy</li>
<li>Online shopping</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zalando has never operated in Portugal and only has access to public data, so it has to rely on the generic segmentation criterias at the beginning. However, it can reuse some trends found in countries with similar cultures and attitudes. For example, data gained in Spain can be used to create narrower segments. Portugees resonate with Spanish a lot!</p>
<h2 id="22-targeting">2.2 Targeting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#22-targeting">#</a></h2>
<p>For service business the target segment is: small-mid size brands, located in one country and operating in other countries, have difficulties with logistics, (medium to large order size/brand size), do not have a strong customer base and data for marketing. The criterias for segment targeting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is measurable: Zalando knows exactly which brands fall into this category from its own platform data.</li>
<li>Substantial and growing market: They are small and mid size or local brands, they have potential for growth, and Zalando platform and logistics, delivery and marketing and design advice can help them grow even faster</li>
<li>Easily accessible: they are already working with each other, so it will be modify buy</li>
<li>Segment is differentiable: they are in the same business as Zalando, they have the need for fashion related logistics and expertise and marketing capabilities</li>
<li>Segment is actionable: just let them know about the new services, and they probably come onboard themselves!</li>
</ul>
<p>Porter’s five forces can also be applicable. There is significant segment rivalry probably only from Amazon, but since it is not focused on fashion and Zalando and these brands work together, it seems no major threat from Amazon should be assumed. It takes a lot of customer base and data and infrastructure to enter this market which is not easy.</p>
<p>Target segmentations for the new markets:
Age between 24-55, currently employed professional, mid level income, interested in non-expensive mainstream products, internet savvy, using social media and used online shopping. The reason is that this group is likely to have good social media and real world connections, so are good to create awareness at the beginning of introduction. They are working class and use online shopping, so likely to try this new platform out. The products presented on the platform should be from world wide well known brands or local brands, at the beginning because the potential customers are familiar with them.</p>
<p>For new features as mentioned before they can rely on the current customer base and provide the offering for everyone already using the platform.</p>
<h2 id="23-branding-and-positioning">2.3 Branding and Positioning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#23-branding-and-positioning">#</a></h2>
<p>Brand is the unique image and perception that Zalando wants its customers to remember about them. What Zalando wants is that everytime a person wants to buy a pair of shoes, they remember Zalando as the first option as they have the experience of easy shopping, fast delivery and free return. If such an image is built in customers&rsquo; minds then the customers will be loyal and keep returning to Zalando for shopping which guarantees a constant stream of revenue.</p>
<p>We divide the branding and positioning strategy into the two different areas considered in this document. First branding and positioning for entering Portugal as a new market. Second, is branding and positioning for new features added to the platform: AI based offerings and automated personal stylist as well as virtual at home showroom.</p>
<p>Brand Resonance Model can be used to identify different elements to build the brand to enter Portugal as a new market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand salience: as Portugal is a new market people might not be aware about Zalando. However, they might have heard it and even be waiting for it to start operating in Portugal as they might have heard it from friends outside the country.</li>
<li>Brand performance: as they have a large customer base in other countries and have grown it over time, we can say that they have performed well enough and this may continue in Portugal as well.</li>
<li>Brand imagery: in my mind as a customer the extrinsic values of Zalando is clear to be fast delivery, easy shopping feeling and free return.</li>
<li>Brand judgements: again myself as a customer quite satisfied with the service received from Zalando.</li>
<li>Brand feelings: maybe not that much related as there must not be that much emotional attachment with the brand.</li>
<li>Brand resonance: maybe for the customers who value free return there might be resonating with the brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different elements of the brand can be checked such as url, logo, platform, different services to see how they are perceived in customers (potential customers) minds. We can also examine the platform and services as whole as a brand element itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memorable: I can judge myself as whenever I have to do shopping the first option coming to my mind is Zalando.</li>
<li>Meaningful: for people who want easy comparison of different brands and do not want to go to shopping malls, the brand is quite meaningful.</li>
<li>Likable: not very much applicable for the generic crowd but for those who use the personal stylists or fashion advice it might be more applicable.</li>
<li>Transferable: it is easily transferable, for example in this case just with minor modifications of the website to local language the whole brand can be transferred to Portugal.</li>
<li>Adaptable: it is adaptable in the sense that easily new brands can be onboarded, enter new segments, add new categories, etc.</li>
<li>Protectable: some elements of the brand are legally protectable such as the logo, private labels and trademarks.</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Competitor analysis based on two features. The first feature is the
  specializing in clothing. The second feature is fast delivery.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Two perceptual maps are introduced here. One shows easy/free return versus specialized in clothing and fashion. The other one is fast delivery versus specialized in clothing. We can see tha Zalando can differentiate itself from the competition :</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast delivery</li>
<li>Free and easy return</li>
</ul>
<p>We can think of these as the supplementary added value to the core services that are more or less provided by all competitors. Such core services are the ability to compare different brands, large number of brands and easy/smooth shopping.
Finally the brand mantra can be stated as:</p>
<p><em><strong>All your favorite brands at your door, with one click! Return, if you don’t like!</strong></em></p>
<p>For the new personalized AI based offering and stylist, this is an innovative solution and probably Zalando will be the pioneer offering such service. It can be offered to current customers of the platform to increase the sales or even attract new customers and decrease unnecessary returns which impose a lot of burden on the company.</p>
<p>The brand mantra for this new feature can be stated as:</p>
<p><em><strong>Your personal stylist, true feeling of happiness!</strong></em></p>
<p>For this new feature, perhaps brand revitalization and reinforcement might be needed since it is new and customers are not aware of it.</p>
<h2 id="24-selection-of-marketing-strategy">2.4 Selection of Marketing Strategy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#24-selection-of-marketing-strategy">#</a></h2>
<p>Zalando is mostly operating in slow economic growth countries and the product life cycle is considered to be at its growth phase (according to Zalando).</p>
<p>Zalando is a leader as a platform should maintain its leadership position by adding new features and entering new segments such as B2B service offerings.</p>
<p>Zalando is considered to be a challenger as it enters the market in Portugal. They would like to first create the awareness of Zalando and its platform in Portugal and then create the same differentiated position in the customers’ minds as they have previously created before in other countries to be known as the best platform for comparing different brands and easy navigation, easy payment and free and simple return specialized in clothing assortments.</p>
<p>Implications of the given scenario for planning</p>
<p>With the given scenario we can expect to have more potential customers in the near future. One of the implications on planning is that we can include a larger extent of people to be included in the target group instead of limiting it to only the age 24-55. Also, the target segment customers do not need to be internet savvy any longer as the new trend suggests that more and more people are going to use online platforms and services.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for such a trend shift during these times is that people have been forced to try these online services and now they have experienced the comfort and they can trust the online payment systems. So, for Zalando to be able to capture more market share they have to be bolder in their differentiation factors in branding and positioning. So they have to emphasize more and more on faster delivery and free returns that other competitors may not have the resources to promise.</p>
<h1 id="section-3-implementation">Section 3: Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-3-implementation">#</a></h1>
<h2 id="31-integrated-marketing-mix">3.1 Integrated Marketing Mix<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#31-integrated-marketing-mix">#</a></h2>
<p>Integrated marketing mix deals with all encounters of the customers with different parts of the business and tries to build up the desired perception of the business and brand and differentiated position in the customers&rsquo; (potential customers) minds.</p>
<p>Like before the focus is on the online retail platform. The corporate strategy goal was:</p>
<ul>
<li>In currently operating countries with above 5% GDP growth
<ul>
<li>Keeping the leader position</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In currently operating countries with slow economic growth
<ul>
<li>Add new features</li>
<li>Enter new segments such as new B2B transport service offering (not the scope of this strategic marketing plan)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In new entering countries (Portugal)
<ul>
<li>Create and raise awareness of the service existence</li>
<li>Marketing focus on competitive advantage of the service, easy order, payment, delivery and return, fast and home delivery</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zalando mainly offers online retail service to consumers. Services are different from products as they are intangible, perishable, inseparable and variable. Zalando falls into the service category of tangible goods with accompanying service as it has to deliver the goods from other brands through their service to customers.</p>
<p>SERVQUAL five determinants of service quality are reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles which we will see how should be addressed in an integrated marketing mix.</p>
<p>Here our focus will also be on the platform mainly as Zalando’s core business.</p>
<h2 id="32-product">3.2 Product<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#32-product">#</a></h2>
<p>The product relevant for integrated marketing mix here is the platform and product package.</p>
<p>For the newly added features Zalando must make sure in every step by using design thinking that the feature is designed to fulfil customers needs by getting continuous feedback, they also must assure it is easy to use and it provides meaningful results. 
packaging and labelling can be also considered as products in this context. Zalando has to make sure their package is of high standard of safety and easy to handle, for example easy to carry and easy to open or repack for return. They have to make sure the shipped items are not damaged or faulty. Also, providing warranty from branding partners could be good marketing practice.</p>
<p>The platform language can have a lot of importance especially in Europe with many different languages. So, they can add portugese language for the platform before entering Portugal can help them for mass adoption significantly.</p>
<h2 id="33-price">3.3 Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#33-price">#</a></h2>
<p>All services offered to customers are free. As a strong customer base gives a huge competitive advantage to Zalando and also prohibits new entrants to the competition it is wise to continue with this strategy and also offer the new features of AI stylist and virtual showroom to customers for free just to increase market share and offer services in Portugal for free to let more people try the service out and build loyalty.</p>
<p>Competitors also provide the platform services for free to attract more customers. So, according to Kotler and Keller six steps of setting the price it is also justified to provide free services to address the competition.</p>
<h2 id="34-place">3.4 Place<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#34-place">#</a></h2>
<p>Zalando pursues omnichannel marketing, the online platform.</p>
<p>They can use a mix of push and pull strategy for marketing, meaning that they can collaborate with brands in their marketing efforts (push strategy) but also try to attract more customers to buy from their platform.</p>
<p>The whole value chain channels are important for marketing integrated mix. Supply chain channels, transport and delivery channels, warehouses and inventories, order channels, payment channels, etc. marketers have to choose and manage the channels.</p>
<p>Specifically for Zalando we know that fast delivery and free return are the differentiators. It is crucial for marketers to make sure inventories, warehouses, transport and delivery channels work in tandem for fast delivery and return to happen as smoothly as possible. As Zalando enters Portugal, they have to prepare the infrastructure in such a way that from first customers the differentiating image of fast delivery and good packaging and free return sticks with customers.</p>
<h2 id="35-promotion">3.5 Promotion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#35-promotion">#</a></h2>
<p>Zalando uses different forms of promotion channels and media communications. This includes heavy social media appearance, bloggers, models, paper and digital magazines, partner brands discounts, coupons and many other forms.</p>
<p>We know that Millennials account for 40% of the world&rsquo;s population by 2020, and they spend a lot of time on social media platforms so it seems reasonable for Zalando to be present on such platforms for promotion of their ecommerce platform and the newly added features.</p>
<p>Speciality for the new features, the innovation adoption curve is very important. Maybe through promotion by the models and social media influencers they can get the 2.5% innovators to try it first and then the early adopters will pick it up and then through word of mouth they reach the tipping point and mass adoption for new features could happen.</p>
<p>The same is true for entering Portugal. Local models and influencers as well as celebrities can be employed at the initial phase of introduction to increase the knowledge and awareness of this platform entering the market.</p>
<h2 id="36-people">3.6 People<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#36-people">#</a></h2>
<p>All people that face customers such as delivery staff and customer support might be very well trained to build up the image that Zalando desires. Delivery staff specially have a very important impact on the perception of people so they must be very well dressed and polite and behave to the highest standard. Customer support must handle complaints professionally and politely to keep the unsatisfied customers returning back for shopping to Zalando.</p>
<h2 id="37-process">3.7 Process<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#37-process">#</a></h2>
<p>Easy use of online retail platforms is crucial for successful business such as Zalando. Customers’ interaction with the service is through the platform so it is very important that the processes done on the platform be as easy and smooth as possible. These processes include navigation, search and comparison, add to box, payment and return processes.</p>
<p>Specially providing personalized offers to avoid confusing customers and delaying the buy, having different payment methods and easy return process are very important. Easy and free return is a differentiator factor for Zalando so they have to make sure the process is clear like having the printed return address in the package helps to create a unique image in customers minds.</p>
<h2 id="38-physical-evidence">3.8 Physical Evidence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#38-physical-evidence">#</a></h2>
<p>The physical evidence that customers encounter is the platform’s website and product packaging as well as delivery staff.  So, Zalando has to make sure that the website is professionally designed. Also, packaging must be well designed and safe to avoid damages on transportation.</p>
<p>Implications of the given scenario for implementation</p>
<p>As the trend shows an increase in ecommerce and online shopping, it surely increases the customers using Zalando services both in short term and long term. In the short term as the infrastructure for transport and delivery or inventory might not be ready for a huge spike it might impact the perception of customers especially the first timers. It is important to inform the customers about the possible delays and unusual circumstances that are incurred to protect the brand image in the long run.</p>
<p>In the long run, they need to prepare the infrastructure to handle this increase in demand to continue keeping the image of fast delivery and free return. They have to employ different promotion campaigns to take advantage of this trend shift and increase their market share for example by providing coupons or special discounts for first time buyers or bonus for recommending to friends.</p>
<h1 id="section-4-feedback-and-control">Section 4: Feedback and Control<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-4-feedback-and-control">#</a></h1>
<h2 id="41-control-of-strategic-marketing-activities">4.1 Control of Strategic Marketing Activities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#41-control-of-strategic-marketing-activities">#</a></h2>
<p>Zalando goal is to engage more customers to use the new features and increase awareness in Portugal and onboard more customers. Different strategic and operational metrics and control plans could be implemented to track the success in reaching these goals.</p>
<p>Strategic goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market share per country of operation</li>
<li>Number of partner brands</li>
<li>Number of customers</li>
<li>Profit</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Number of users using new features</li>
</ul>
<p>The operational metrics to monitor particularly important for Zalando could be as follows in different categories.</p>
<p>Platform use process:</p>
<ul>

<li>Brands of returns</li>
<li>Feedback on returns
Brand partners to warehouse transport:</li>
<li>Time from order to receive in Zalando inventory</li>
</ul>
<p>Metrics to follow up on success rate of marketing promotions also need to be tracked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of social media to website visits</li>
<li>Impact of discounts</li>
<li>Impact of bonus and coupons</li>
<li>Blog reads</li>
<li>Impact of influencers and celebrities</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, change introduces its own risks. Now Zalando wants to go through two major changes. One is the introduction of features that are new across industry and one is entering Portugal. These both could impose operational and strategic marketing risks. The likelihood of success of these changes must be considered and make sure the impact of failure is justifiable in terms of cost and most importantly the brand image in the minds of customers.</p>
<p>Implications of the given scenario for feedback and control</p>
<p>All the above mentioned metrics to control will be useful also for this trend shift. Particularly Zalando must follow this trend shift in longer timeframes to exactly monitor how this trend change is happening, in which areas and countries, what type of products and how it is impacting the delivery times and how to identify inventory or transport service possible bottlenecks and issues. Such trend shift minitorings helps to get prepared for the increase in demand impact on infrastructure in the long run.</p>
